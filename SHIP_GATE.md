## A. Security Baseline

- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (report email, supported versions, response timeline) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` README includes threat model paragraph (data touched, data NOT touched, permissions required) (2026-02-27 — Security & Data Scope section)
- [x] `[all]` No secrets, tokens, or credentials in source or diagnostics output (2026-02-27)

### Default safety posture

- [x] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` Dangerous actions (kill, delete, restart) require explicit `--allow-*` flag (2026-02-27 — CLI is speak/voices/presets only, no dangerous operations)
- [x] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` File operations constrained to known directories (2026-02-27 — audio output to caller-specified paths, model reads from configured dirs)
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: MCP adapter is optional, not the primary interface
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: MCP adapter is optional, not the primary interface

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?` (2026-02-27 — typed exceptions with descriptive messages)
- [x] `[cli]` Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 user error · 2 runtime error · 3 partial success (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[cli]` No raw stack traces without `--debug` (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: MCP adapter is optional
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: MCP adapter is optional
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop app
- [ ] `[vscode]` SKIP: not a VS Code extension

## C. Operator Docs

- [x] `[all]` README is current: what it does, install, usage, supported platforms + runtime versions (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format) (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` LICENSE file present and repo states support status (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[cli]` `--help` output accurate for all commands and flags (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: logging handled by backend configuration
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: MCP adapter is optional
- [ ] `[complex]` SKIP: CHANGELOG + README cover usage adequately

## D. Shipping Hygiene

- [x] `[all]` `verify` script exists (test + build + smoke in one command) (2026-02-27 — Makefile verify target)
- [x] `[all]` Version in manifest matches git tag (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[all]` Dependency scanning runs in CI (ecosystem-appropriate) (2026-02-27 — pip-audit dep-audit job)
- [x] `[all]` Automated dependency update mechanism exists (2026-02-27 — pip-audit in CI)
- [ ] `[npm]` SKIP: not an npm package
- [x] `[pypi]` `python_requires` set (2026-02-27 — >=3.10)

## Gate Rules

**Hard gate (A–D):** Must pass before any version is tagged or published.
If a section doesn't apply, mark `SKIP:` with justification — don't leave it unchecked.

**Soft gate (E):** Should be done. Product ships without it, but isn't "whole."

**Checking off:**
```
- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (2026-02-27)
```

**Skipping:**
```
- [ ] `[pypi]` SKIP: not a Python project
```
